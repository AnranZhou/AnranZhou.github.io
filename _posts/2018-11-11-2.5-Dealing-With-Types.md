## Dealing with Types
As our programs get more complicated, weâ€™ll see that the types we use also get more complicated.
* some types are hard to spell
* hard to determine the exact type we need.

### 1. Type Aliases
A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type.

#### 1.1 two keywords
* typedef
	```C++
		typedef double wages;
	```
* using 
	```C++
		using SI = Sales_item
	```
	
#### 1.2 Pointers, const and Type Aliases
```C++
	typedef char *pstring;
	const pstring cstr = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
	const char *cstr = 0; // wrong interpretation of const pstring cstr
```

### 2. The `auto` Type Specifier
If we want to store the value of an expression in a variable. We have to know the type of that expression to define that variable. By using the `auto` type specifier, we can let the compiler figure out the type for us. So when using `auto`, we must initialize it.

#### 2.1 features
* auto-deduced type have no reference by default.
* auto-deduced type have no top-level const but have low-level const


```C++
// references
int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r; // a is an int (r is an alias for i, which has type int)

// const
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci; // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr; // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level) autod=&i; // d isan int*(& ofan int objectis int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int*(& of a const object is low-level const)

// if we want a reference to the auto-deduced type(allow top-level const at the same time)
auto &g = ci;  // g is a const int& that is bound to ci

// if we want the deduced type having the top-level const
const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int
const auto &j = 42; // ok: we can bind a const reference to a literal
```

### 3. The `decltype` Type Specifier
Sometimes we want to define a variable with a type that the compiler deduces from an expression but do not want to use that expression to initialize the variable.

Use `decltype` to returns the type of its operand. The compiler analyzes the expression to determine its type but does not evaluate the expression.

#### 3.1 fearures
* expression is a variable
	* `decltype` handles references
	* `decltype` handles top-level const  

	```C++
	const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
	decltype(ci) x = 0; // x has type const int
	decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and must be initialized
	```

* expression is not a variable
	```C++
	// decltype of an expression can be a reference type
	int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
	decltype(r + 0) b; // ok: addition yields an int; b is an (uninitialized) int 
	decltype(*p) c; // error: c is int& and must be initialized
	
	// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference 
	decltype((i)) d; // error: d is int& and must be initialized 
	decltype(i) e; // ok: e is an (uninitialized) int
	```
