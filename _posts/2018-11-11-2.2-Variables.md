## Variable
* A variable provides us with named storage.
* Each variable in C++ has a type. The type determines
	* size (range of values)
	* layout
	* the set of operations

### 1. Variable Definition and Initialization
Format: `type specifier` + a set of `declarators` seperated by `commas` ended with a `semicolon`.

#### 1.1 initializers
An object that is initialized gets the specified value at the moment it is created.
* initialization and assignment are different operations in C++.

#### 1.2 list initializations
The generalized use of curly braces for initialization is referred to as list initialization.
* The compiler will not let us list initialize variables of built-in type if the initializer might lead to the loss of information

	```C++
		long double ld = 3.1415926536;
		int a{ld}, b = {ld}; // error: narrowing conversion required 
		int c(ld), d = ld; // ok: but value will be truncated
	```

#### 1.3 Default Initialization
When we define a variable without an initializer, the variable is default initialized.
* Built-in Type Variables
	* define outside a function
		* initialized as 0
	* define inside a function
		* undefined
* Class
	* determined by the class implicit initializers.

### 2. Variable Declaration and Definition
#### 2.1 Background -- Separate Compilation
Separate compilation lets us split our programs into several files, each of which can be compiled independently.

#### 2.2  Static Typing
types are checked at compile time.
* The compiler checks whether the operations we write are supported by the types we use.

#### 2.3 declaration vs. definition
* A declaration makes a name known to the program. 
	* A file that wants to use a name defined elsewhere includes a declaration for that name. 
	* A variable declaration specifies the type and name of a variable.
	
* A definition creates the associated entity.
	* A variable definition is a declaration
	* In addition to specifying the name and type
	* allocates storage and provide initial values.
	
* Variables must be defined exactly once but can be declared many times.
* Add the `extern` keyword and may not provide an explicit initializer to define a declaration.
	```C++
	extern int i; // declares but does not define i 
	int j; // declares and defines j
	extern double pi = 3.1416; // definition
	// It is an error to provide an initializer on an extern inside a function.
	```

### 3. Identifiers
* Identifiers in C++ can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character.
* Identifiers must begin with either a letter or an underscore. 
* Identifiers are case-sensitive.

#### 3.1 C++ keywords

#### 3.2 C++ alternative operator names

### 4. Scope of a Name
A scope is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meaning.
* Most scopes in C++ are delimited by curly braces.
* Names are visible from the point where they are declared until the end of the scope in which the declaration appears.

#### 4.1 global scope vs. block scope
* Names defined outside a function have the global scope.
	* can be used throughout the program.
* Names defined inside a function have the block scope.
	* variables in the block scope can override variables in the global scope.

	```C++
	#include <iostream>
	// Program for illustration purposes only: It is bad style for a function
	// to use a global variable and also define a local variable with the same name 
	int reused = 42; // reused has global scope
	int main()
	{
	int unique = 0; // unique has block scope
	// output #1: uses global reused; prints 42 0
	std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
	int reused = 0; // new, local object named reused hides global reused
	// output #2: uses local reused; prints 0 0
	std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
	// output #3: explicitly requests the global reused; prints 42 0
	std::cout << ::reused << " " << unique << std::endl; return 0;
	}
	```

#### 4.2 nested scope
Scopes can contain other scopes.
* The contained (or nested) scope is referred to as an inner scope.
*  the containing scope is the outer scope.
* Once a name has been declared in a scope, that name can be used by scopes nested inside that scope.
